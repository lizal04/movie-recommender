# 🎬 Movie Recommender System (Mood-Based)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a mood-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on the user’s current emotional state rather than traditional collaborative filtering (like Netflix-style systems). Instead of relying on user history or ratings, the system asks users how they feel and returns personalized movie suggestions accordingly.

## 💡 Key Idea
Traditional recommendation systems rely on collaborative filtering, which often forces users to spend a lot of time browsing, rating, or searching through large libraries before finding something they like.

This project takes a simpler and more human-centered approach:
👉 Instead of making users filter through content, it directly asks what they are feeling and immediately provides personalized movie recommendations based on their mood.

The goal is to reduce decision fatigue and make movie selection faster, more intuitive, and more personalized and satisfactory.

This project takes a different approach:
👉 It maps **human emotions → movie categories → personalized recommendations**

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

- Some very specific filter combinations (e.g., horror + thrilling+ more than 2.5 hrs watch lenght) may return limited results due to dataset coverage
- Currently pulls top 100 movies from TMDB; expanding dataset would improve recommendation variety
- Future: implement fallback logic to suggest "close matches" when exact filters return no results
